DesignPatterns
==============

C++ implementation of some design patterns.

* __Composite__
  * Treat _individual_ objects and _compositions_ of objects uniformly.
  * Useful to represent hierarchies of items

* __Double Dispatch__
  * Basic mechanism of the _Visitor_ pattern.
  * Understanding Double Dispatch means understanding _Visitor_

* __CompositeVisitor__
  * A perfect match of two patterns (_Composite_ and _Visitor_)
  * Useful to represent and process hierarchies of items

* __State__
  * Represents a finite state machine (FSM)
  * Very similar to the _Strategy_ pattern, just different intent
