DesignPatterns
==============

C++ implementation of some design patterns.

* __Composite__
  * Treat _individual_ objects and _compositions_ of objects uniformly.
  * Useful to represent hierarchies of items


* __Double Dispatch__
  * Basic mechanism of the _Visitor_ pattern.
  * Understanding double dispatch means understanding _Visitor_


* __Composite Visitor__
  * A perfect match of two patterns (_Composite_ and _Visitor_)
  * Useful to represent and process hierarchies of items


* __State__
  * Represents a finite state machine (FSM)
  * Very similar to the _Strategy_ pattern, just different intent


* __Event Notifier__
  * Based on ["Event notifier: a pattern for event notification"](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=335870)
  * _(implemented in Java)_

* __Perception__
  * Application of _Abstract Factory_, _Composite_, and _Visitor_
  * _(works on Linux and OSX)_
